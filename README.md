# Mint your own NFT collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off

* Setup for a weekend learning project at Buildspaces (buildspace.so)
* Playing around with some Solidity fundamentals, my naming is decieving, the front end basically a webform for adding some text and metadata on chain.
* FE built and deployed at https://nftdropportal.sil3ntr.repl.co/
  * UI is my bad take on something retro, will update this once I get a bit more react knowledge.
