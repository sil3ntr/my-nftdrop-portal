# Mint your own NFT collection and ship a Web3 app to show them off

* Setup for a weekend learning project at Buildspaces (buildspace.so)
* Playing around with some Solidity fundamentals, my naming is decieving, the front end basically a webform for adding some text and metadata on chain.
* The contract was funded and each message submitted via the contract has 50% chance of recieving 0.0001 ether
* FE built and deployed at https://nftdropportal.sil3ntr.repl.co/
  * UI is my bad take on something retro, will update this once I get a bit more react knowledge
  * Also need to fix the counter to render the total number of tx's via the contract

Once your wallet is connected and an etherium object is confirmed it renders the previous messages along with some metadata collected at the time inc timestamp.
